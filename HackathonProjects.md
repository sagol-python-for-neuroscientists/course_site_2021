# Hackathon Projects

## Parkinson's Disease evaluation from a prolonged piano playing task

### Jason Friedman's Lab

Subjects were given six weeks to play a piano equipped with a logging device. The project's main objective is to create a dashboard which will enable easily viewing the collected data, calculating various statistics with emphasis on quantitative digitography (QDG) over selected segements, exporting selected segmenets, etc.

## Comparing sleep patterns as measured in actigraphy versus EEG

### Yuval Nir's Lab

20 subjects were mointored during sleep using both actigraphy ([wrist-watch](http://ambulatory-monitoring.com/specialoffer_RTSW.html) motion sensors) and EEG. The goal of the project is to asssess the relationship between sleep scoring as evaluated using EEG versus its evaluation from actigraphy using standard measures. Basic data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization will be required.

## Translating expectation maximization from MATLAB to Python

### Nitzan Shahar's Lab

In the field of computational neuropsychiatry, hierarchical parameter estimation is commonly implemented using expectation maximization (EM). The focus of this project it to translate the functionality of a popular MATLAB library used for this purpose ([emfit](https://github.com/mpc-ucl/emfit/)) to Python. The final goal is to create a "complete" foundation for easy EM calculation using a well documented and tested Python packcage.

## Autonomic nervous system reactivity during VR stimulation

### Meir Plotnik's Lab

Autonomic nervous system related signals (galvanic skin response, ECG, respiration rate) are collected in real-time during VR exposure to relaxing vs. stressful stimuli. The goal of this project is to use the collected measures to create a composite "stress-level" score that can be calculated in real time and used to generate a bio-feedback loop by altering the VR setting.

## Quantifying the interaction between blood vessels and neurons

### Pablo Blinder's Lab

The project's goal is to use an in-house library created in conjunction with Dan Halperin's lab from the CS department to compute the alpha shapes of real neuronal and vascular data. Alpha shapes are a measure of complexity and "hiddenness" taken from the field of computational geometry, and we believe that its application in the context of neurons in general, and the interaction and position of them inside the vasculature in particular, is novel. In this project, we seek to apply this novel metric to the most detailed piece of the mouse brain ever reconstructed through serial electron microscopy<sup><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/11/03/460618.full.pdf">[1]</a></sup>.

## EAG quality assurance, preprocessing and visualization

### Amir Ayali's Lab

In this project the students are required to create a dashboard which will allow researchers to navigate a directory of collected EAG data according to some predefined directory structure. The dashboard is meant to provide the user with basic QA and preprocessing options, as well as offer visualizations and exporting functions.


## Predicting preferences based on EEG data

### Dino Levy's Lab

Subjects watched 6-second commercials during EEG data acquisition and after each commercial were asked to score the viewed commercial and product in terms of personal liking. The goal of this project is to create a model to predict subjects' scores from the EEG recordings. Some prior familiarity with EEG signal preprocessing, feature generation, and modeling is recommended.
