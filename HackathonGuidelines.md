# Hackathon Guidelines

* The hackathon will take place from the morning of Wednesday, June 30th, until Thursday night.
* The assigned group are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H_ec1Ti4Kbi2NGmml78o5FGm-COBWOF0/view?usp=sharing).
* There will be a kick-off meeting Wednesday morning at 9:00.
* Each group will receive some sample data on the day before the hackathon, and will meet with their assigned mentor either on the day before or the morning of the hackathon, dependeing on the mentors' and group members' availability.
* Each group will schedule a presentation with Gal and me on Monday, July 5th, to showcase their work.
* The projects are expected to be the result of two days' work, and will be graded accordingly. The rationale for scheduling the presentations on Monday is to give you the full two days for coding and not force you to have to prepare the presentation during the weekend.
* Grading:
  * 50% - Code quality
    * Design patterns and coding paradigms
    * PEP8
    * Integration of the scientific Python stack
    * Tests
    * Git
    * Docstrings
    * Documentation (informative README or more)
    * Packaging and PyPI
  * 30% - Team collaboration
  * 20% - Does it work?
* Please join the [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/pythonhackathon2021/shared_invite/zt-rwwufrl1-D50IQBjSXm6LVsp0aTvYMg). Each group will have a dedicated channel for general communications, Gal and me will be available throughout the duration of the hackathon.
